# Introduction

This project is meant to be a web application that has a collection of AI tools. It is built using Flask for the back-end and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the front-end. This project is still ongoing.

Note: This webapp was built on Python 3.12.4


# Features

- Upload audio files for transcription.
- Dark/Light mode toggle.
- Mobile-friendly interface.
- Flask (Back-end)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Front-end)
- OpenAI Whisper (For transcription)

# Demo

Link: https://myai-2kcl.onrender.com

As this is hosted on the base plan of render, some CSS files may not load/take a while to load.

The AI function may also not work due to low CPU of the server.

# Future plans

When I have time, I might include in other AI tools. Such as Image to Text, Text to speech etc..
